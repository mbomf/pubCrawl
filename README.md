## Pub Crawl

## Project Description:

Pub Crawl ErryDay LLC., is a comprehensive and innovative tool for bringing the power of creativity and user ecxperience to your fingrtips. This tool is designed with the user in mind, and creates an experience by allowing the user to be completely in control. When a user decides he wants to create a Bar Crawl with us, we give them unlimited opporunity with our partnering cities. The program than captures the user's city selection, the amount of people they will be crawling with, and the locations that the want to crawl. The user then selectsthe individual bars they want to visit and are built a dynamic map that allows the user to visibly see the crawl and save the craw; for later. When the user is satisfied with their crawl choices, they are built an itinerary that is saved to firbase and can be accessed at all times on the page.
